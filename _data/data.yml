projects:
  - title: Osseus - Fracture Detection
    time: 01/2020 - 06/2020
    company: University of Washington
    details: |
      - Developed an algorithm to detect bone fractures from the acoustic response, using DSP techniques(using Librosa) and ML.
      - Deployed algorithm on the mobile platform by developing a mobile application using Flutter and hosted backend on Azure.
      - Achieved over 95% accuracy except for smaller bones(like fingers bones ~70% accuracy), published the results in IEEE-GHTC-2020.
  - title: Global Wheat Detection
    time: 04/2020 - 06-2020
    company: Personal Project @ Kaggle
    details: |
      - Implemented transfer learning on the state of the art object detection algorithms including DETR, Efficient-DET, Faster RCNN, RetinaNet and YOLOv5. Achieved highest MAP score of 0.65.
      - Used NMS(Non-Maximal Suppression) to make ensembles from above-described models and improved score to 0.69.
      - Replaced NMS by implementing WBF(Weighted Box Fusion), which increased the score to 0.71.
      - At last implemented Pseudo-labelling, to deal with a smaller dataset, which resulted in a final score of 0.725.
